Using LINQ for SQL:
- LINQ syntax gets checked by compiler before it hits the SQL server, possible performance gain over SQL which will hit the SQL server first, then check correctness
	(No SQL statements in double quotes; strings get ignored by the compiler, hence it won't know if the syntax is correct)
- Type Safe, don't need to know the data types because this gets verified on the client (IntelliSense should help here)
- Object Oriented:
	Table			=>	Class
	Columns			=>	- Property
	Rows/Records	=>	- Instance
	Stored Proced.	=>	- Methods
